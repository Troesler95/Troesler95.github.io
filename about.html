            Born and raised in the small town of Sinclairville, NY, I've had a knack for technology all my life,
            though I didn't always know it. After high school I spent two years pursuing a music degree having a
            nagging itch that I wasn't where I was supposed to be. After taking Intro to Computer Science at Fredonia,
            my professor asked why one earth I wasn't a Computer Science major! After a lot of mulling,
            I decided to take the leap and haven't looked back! Since, I've gone from green behind the ears to
            competent Software Engineer in a matter of two years. Imagine what I can do in two more!

    <h1>Why Computer Science?</h1>

    <h3>Why, passion of course!</h3>

            From learning HTML and CSS for fun in high school to dedicating my breaks to studying advanced features
            of C++ and the STL, my unique thirst for knowledge transfers well to Computer Science. Computer Science
            is a field that never ceases to challenge, which is much of the reason I'm drawn to it!
            Not only that, but I love the chase of that next big challenge, and consequently the next big solution!
            I spend my free time learning new languages and technologies not because I have to but because I want to!

            When I'm not learning a new language or working on projects, I like to do all sorts of stuff for fun! I often
            mess around with my Audrino and my Pine64 SBC (with a few projects in the works). And
            yes, to fill  the computer programmer trope, I play videogames from time to time! I love RPGs such as
            Elder Scrolls and Fallout, and of course I play Overwatch, though
            nowhere near competitvely! When I'm sick of staring at a screen I love to go outside and enjoy the
            beautiful outdoors. I often hike, fish, play tennis (however bad I may be), and take my dogs out to play!

            I'm a rare breed of employee. To me, Software Engineering is just plain fun! I love the chase of the
            solution to a problem and if I learn something new along the way, that only adds to the joy. Not only that,
            I have been working in customer service for years now and have developed excellent interpersonal skills
            which leads to less arguing and more work in a team based setting or customer interaction! If you want a
            team player who makes corny jokes and loves making software, I'm your guy!
